Void Elements!

Not all elements have a closing tag. Some elements are void elements, meaning they do not have a closing tag. 
Examples of void elements include:<br>

img tag
<img
  src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdn/beginner-html-site/gh-pages/images/firefox-icon.png"
  alt="Firefox icon" /> 


  Attributes
elemetns have attributes that provide additional information about the element.
<img 
src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content/Basic_HTML_syntax/grumpy-cat-attribute-small.png" />

<p>Attributes have extra information about the elements tha tdont appear in the content, i.e. class attributes used to target element with style infromation</p>

for img element takes attributres including:

src - which is required and specifies the path to the image
alt - which specifies the text description for the image
width - which specifies the width of the image in pixels
height - which specifies the height of the image in pixels

Boolean Attributes
Sometimes, attributes are written without a value. This is fine , and is called a boolean attribute. the boolean attribute is always set to true regardless of value. If the boolean attribute is not present, it is set to false. <br>
<input type="text" /> <br>
<input type="text" disabled />

<p>In the example above, the disabled attribute is a boolean attribute. It is set to true, and the input element is greyed out and unclickable.</p>


Omitting quotes around attribute values
If you look at code for a lot of other sites, you might come across a number of strange markup styles, including attribute values without quotes. This is permitted in certain circumstances, but it can also break your markup in other circumstances. 


Also lowkey single quotes and double quotes are allowed too its just a matter of preference.

except you can nest double quotes inside single quotes and vice versa.

To use quote marks inside other quote marks of the same type (single quote or double quote), use character references. For example, this will break:


<a href="https://www.example.com" title="An "interesting" reference">A link to my example.</a>

Instead, you need to do this:


<a href="https://www.example.com" title="An &quot;interesting&quot; reference">A link to my example.</a>
